                <h2>Re-weirding the Internet</h2>
                <div id="post1">
                    <p>For my HTML project I decided to focus on my own artistic inspiration and interests, as well as emphasize the importance of preserving older works in a time when modernization has fostered misappropriation and generated works. The concept of creating a website from scratch becomes a rebellion to the modern, standardized form of the internet I often witness. “Re-weirding” the internet allows us to slow down and explore things at a regular pace rather than be bombarded with an overflux of graphics and information. </p>

                    <p>Early internet culture involved simply wandering sites and taking it all in. My look at early photography points out the humanity and imperfection in older works, contrasting automatically generated works by Artificial Intelligence that are now commonly found on the internet. To embody these ideas in my ASCII art, I created a fishbowl to convey how the internet can limit our perspective on things and also make us feel as though we are under constant scrutiny. In The Shallows by Nicholas Carr, he states that, “Not all distractions are bad. As most of us know from experience, if we concentrate too intensively on a tough problem, we can get stuck in a mental rut.” (Carr 119)</p>

                    <p>Re-weirding the internet introduces positive forms of distraction and an outlet for creativity. Early artworks and web pages embody this idea of creative discovery and inspiration. Within a society that is becoming increasingly uniform and minimalist in certain ways, going back to an early manner of navigating and creating on the internet reduces sameness and allows web pages to truly reflect the person who made them. It preserves a sense of humanity in a world where even simple human interaction is replaced by technology. Hand-coded pages, unconventional fonts, and vibrant colors are all small but rebellious aspects of a site that is unapologetically unique and reflective of our personal views.</p>
